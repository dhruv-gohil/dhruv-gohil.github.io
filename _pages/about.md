Hi, I'm Dhruv Gohil, a Master's student in Chemical Engineering at UCLA, working in the [Advanced Process Control Lab](https://pdclab.seas.ucla.edu) under the guidance of Professor [Panagiotis Christofides](https://samueli.ucla.edu/people/panagiotis-christofides/). My research focuses on developing advanced cybersecure control architectures for nonlinear chemical processes. More specifically, I work on multi-layer encrypted control strategies that enhance resilience against cyberattacks by integrating nonlinear model-based control with encrypted linear controllers. My work applies these techniques to real-world chemical processes, to improve both security and process stability.

I am interested in process engineering, data science, and technology-driven innovation. I've worked as a CMP Process Engineering Intern at [TSMC](https://www.tsmc.com/english), where I designed automated data analysis systems to improve semiconductor defect detection, and after graduation, I will be returning as a full-time Process Engineer. On top of that, I've also been a Teaching Assistant at UCLA, guiding students in learning mathematical modeling and experimental techniques.

In my spare time, I like playing squash, exploring new countries, and reading fantasy books (especially Brandon Sanderson's). I also tinker with home servers and automation projects as a hobby.

Feel free to check out my projects, publications, or contact me!
