Hi, I'm Dhruv Gohil, a Master's student in Chemical Engineering at UCLA with interests in process engineering, data science, and technology-driven innovation. I enjoy solving tough problems, whether it's in semiconductor manufacturing, advanced process control, or optimization.

I've worked as a CMP Process Engineering Intern at TSMC, where I designed automated data analysis systems to improve semiconductor defect detection, and after graduation, I will be returning as a full-time Process Engineer. On top of that, I've also been a Teaching Assistant at UCLA, guiding students in learning mathematical modeling and experimental techniques.

In my spare time, I like playing squash, exploring new countries, and reading fantasy books (especially Brandon Sanderson's). I also tinker with home servers and automation projects as a hobby.

Feel free to check out my projects, publications, or contact me!
